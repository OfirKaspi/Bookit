## Technologies Used

- **React:** Powering the frontend to deliver a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Enhancing styles and ensuring a mobile-first, modern design.
- **React Hook Form and Query:** Streamlining form management and API data fetching.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Ensuring secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Stripe:** Facilitating payment processing for room reservations.
- **Cloudinary:** Efficiently managing and storing images in the cloud.
- **TypeScript:** Bringing static typing to enhance code robustness.
- **Playwright:** Used for end-to-end testing to ensure application reliability.
- **MongoDB and Mongoose:** Serving as the backend database for storing application data.
- **Node.js and Express:** Providing the backend server infrastructure.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript brings an extra layer of reliability to the development process by introducing static typing. This ensures early error detection, improved code maintainability, and enhanced developer productivity. With TypeScript, the codebase becomes more robust, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors and making the development process more predictable.

## Testing

### End-to-End Testing with Playwright

Bookit employs end-to-end testing using Playwright. This approach allows us to simulate real user interactions, ensuring that critical user flows, such as booking a room and navigating the application, function as expected. Playwright's cross-browser compatibility and automation capabilities contribute to the reliability and robustness of our application.
